## üéØ The Pitch

### [0:00-0:30] The Problem

**"Every day, 500 million pieces of fake news are shared online. This costs our economy $78 billion annually and literally kills people**

**Current fact-checkers fail because they're too slow - fake news spreads 6 times faster than corrections. They're centralized, so half the population doesn't trust them. And worst of all, there's no economic incentive to verify truth.**

**We need a new paradigm."**

### [0:30-1:00] Our Solution

**"DeFacto Protocol transforms truth verification into a profitable marketplace. Think of it as the New York Stock Exchange for information.**

**Users stake cryptocurrency on whether news is true or false. If they're right, they earn. If they're wrong, they lose their stake. It's prediction markets meets Wikipedia - but with real money at stake.**

**We built this on Algorand because only Algorand offers 3.7-second finality, unlimited storage through boxes, and carbon-negative infrastructure. This isn't possible on Ethereum or other chains."**

### [1:00-1:30] Technical Innovation

**"Here's what makes DeFacto revolutionary:**

**First, we use hybrid storage - content lives on IPFS for pennies, but immutable hashes are stored on Algorand. This means unlimited scale at minimal cost.**

**Second, our custom smart contracts implement quadratic voting - this prevents wealthy actors from dominating truth consensus. One person can't buy the truth.**

**Third, we built an automated market maker for prediction markets. As more people bet 'true', the price rises, creating real-time truth probability."**

### [1:30-2:00] Live Demo Points

**"Let me show you it working.**

*[If showing demo]*
**When I submit this claim about recent AI news, watch - it's on IPFS and Algorand in under 4 seconds. Now anyone can bet on its truth value. See the market price? 73% probability it's true based on crowd wisdom.**

**Validators stake reputation tokens to verify. Get it right consistently, build reputation and earn more. Get it wrong, lose everything. Real consequences for lying."**


### [2:30-3:00] Vision & Call to Action

**"Imagine a world where lying is unprofitable. Where truth emerges from markets, not authorities. Where communities own their news platforms instead of billionaires.**

**With AI making fake content trivial to create, DeFacto becomes essential infrastructure - the TCP/IP of truth.**

**Join us in building the future where honesty pays better than lies. Thank you."**
