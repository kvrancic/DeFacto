## ü§ñ How to Use AI for Your Implementation

### Step 1: Prepare Your AI Assistant
Feed your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) these documents in order:
```
1. Copy-paste CLAUDE.md
2. Copy-paste ANTI_PROPAGANDA_DESIGN_SIMPLE.md  
3. Copy-paste PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
4. Copy-paste your section from DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
5. Copy-paste MASTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

### Step 2: Request Your Custom Guide
Ask your AI:
```
"Based on these documents, create an EXTREMELY detailed step-by-step 
implementation guide for [YOUR ROLE] that I can follow command by command. 

Include:
- Every single file I need to create (with code definitions, snippets and explanations) 
- Every command to run (with expected output)
- Guide to perform test scripts after each feature (do not include the test scripts in the guide, but note them frequently)
- Error handling and edge cases (do not include the test scripts in the guide)
- Integration tests with other services (do not include the test scripts in the guide)

Expand any features that seem incomplete and add production-ready 
improvements like logging, caching, and retry logic."
```

### Step 3: Implement Step by Step
- Follow your AI-generated guide command by command
- Run test scripts after EACH step
- If something fails, ask AI to debug
- Save all test scripts for later use

## üîó Critical Integration Points

### Everyone MUST Use These Exact Values

```python
# Categories (case-sensitive!)
VALID_CATEGORIES = ["news", "science", "politics", "health", "technology"]

# Status values (exact strings!)
CLAIM_STATUS = ["UNVERIFIED", "VERIFIED", "FALSE", "DISPUTED"]

# Shared parameters
MIN_VALIDATORS = 5
MIN_STAKE = 10
MAX_STAKE = 100
INITIAL_REPUTATION = 100
VOTING_PERIOD = 86400  # 24 hours
```

### API Contract (Backend ‚Üî Frontend)
```
POST /claims/submit       - Submit new claim
GET  /claims/{id}        - Get specific claim
GET  /claims             - List claims (paginated)
POST /validations/vote   - Submit vote
GET  /validations/pending - Get claims to validate
```

### Blockchain Data Format
```
Storage: "QmIPFSHash|category|status"
Example: "QmTest123|news|UNVERIFIED"
```

## üìã Daily Workflow

### part 1 
1. Pull latest code: `git pull`
2. Run your verify script
3. Join standup meeting
4. Share any integration changes

### part 2 
- Implement features from your guide
- Test after each feature
- Commit working code frequently
- Alert team of any interface changes

### part 3
1. Run integration tests
2. Push your code: `git push`
3. Update progress in Slack
4. Note any blockers

---

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot connect to Algorand"
```bash
algokit localnet stop
algokit localnet start
```

### "IPFS not responding"
```bash
ipfs shutdown
ipfs daemon
```

### "Port already in use"
```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :8000  # (or 3000, 8001)
# Kill it
kill -9 [PID]
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Node.js
npm install
```

## üÜò Getting Help

### If You're Stuck
1. Check error message carefully
2. Search in documentation
3. Ask your AI for debugging help
4. Post in team WhatsApp with:
   - What you're trying to do
   - Exact error message
   - What you've tried

---

## üéØ Definition of Done

Your part is complete when:
1. ‚úÖ All features implemented
2. ‚úÖ Tests passing
3. ‚úÖ Documentation updated
4. ‚úÖ Code reviewed by teammate
5. ‚úÖ No critical bugs
6. ‚úÖ Can demo your part

---

## üöÄ Starting Services

### Correct Order (Important!)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# 1. Docker Desktop (manual - ensure running)
# 2. Algorand LocalNet
algokit localnet start

# 3. IPFS
ipfs daemon &

# 4. Deploy contracts (first time only)
cd contracts && python deploy.py && cd ..

# 5. API
cd api && uvicorn src.main:app --reload &

# 6. Frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev &

# 7. ML Service (optional)
cd ml-service && uvicorn src.main:app --port 8001 &
```

## üìù Final Notes

### Remember
- **Test early, test often** - Don't wait until the end
- **Communicate changes** - Tell team immediately if interfaces change
- **Ask for help** - Better to ask than be stuck
- **Document as you go** - Don't leave it for the end
- **Have fun** - We're building something important!

### Success Criteria
- Core flow works: Submit ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Validate
- All services integrate properly
- Can demo full lifecycle of a claim
- No critical bugs blocking demo
