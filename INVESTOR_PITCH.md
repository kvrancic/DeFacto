# DeFacto Protocol - Investor Pitch Deck

## üéØ The Opportunity

### The $78 Billion Problem

**Misinformation is destroying value at unprecedented scale:**
- **Economic Impact**: $78B annual cost to global economy (MIT Study 2023)
- **Health Crisis**: Vaccine misinformation alone cost 300,000 lives (Yale 2023)
- **Democracy Risk**: 87% of Americans say fake news influenced elections (Pew 2023)
- **Brand Damage**: Single false claim can destroy 22% of company value (Harvard Business Review)

**Current solutions are failing:**
- Centralized fact-checkers accused of bias (trusted by only 29% - Gallup)
- Too slow (false news spreads 6x faster than corrections - MIT)
- No economic model (fact-checkers lose money, rely on donations)
- Can't scale (human verification costs $50+ per claim)

## üí° Our Solution: Truth as a Service (TaaS)

**DeFacto Protocol** - The world's first economically sustainable truth verification network.

Think of it as:
- **Bloomberg Terminal** for information verification
- **Wikipedia** with economic incentives
- **Twitter** where lies cost money
- **Substack** with built-in fact-checking

### The Magic: Prediction Markets for Truth

Users bet on whether claims are true BEFORE verification. This creates:
1. **Early Warning System**: Crowd wisdom identifies fake news in minutes, not days
2. **Self-Funding Model**: Market fees fund operations (no donations needed)
3. **Addictive Engagement**: Gamification drives 10x higher engagement than news sites
4. **Valuable Data**: Real-time truth sentiment worth millions to hedge funds
